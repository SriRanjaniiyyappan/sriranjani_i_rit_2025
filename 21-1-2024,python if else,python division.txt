#2.Task
#The provided code stub reads two integers,  and , from STDIN.

#Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division,  // . The second line should contain the result of float division,  / .

#No rounding or formatting is necessary.

#Example


#The result of the integer division .
#The result of the float division is .
#Print:

#0
#0.6
#Input Format

The first line contains the first integer, .
The second line contains the second integer, .

#Output Format

Print the two lines as described above.
